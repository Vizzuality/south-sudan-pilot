# South Sudan Pilot

The South Sudan Pilot aims to develop first-generation flood and drought hazard maps for the country and create a pilot tool to improve access to water management data. By consolidating dispersed hydrological information and addressing data gaps, the pilot seeks to inform water resource management and investment decisions.

The platform is divided into 2 Node.js applications:

- a Content Management System (CMS) located in the `/cms` folder
- a client application located in the `/client` folder

More detailed documentation and instructions on how to run the applications are available in each of the folders.
